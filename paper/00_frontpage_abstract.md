## **Abstract**

Large language models (LLMs) trained by independent organizations on different corpora exhibit spontaneous convergence toward shared semantic structures when exposed to identical structured prompts. This study documents cross-model semantic convergence across **16 independent LLMs** representing 10 distinct organizations and architectural families (OpenAI GPT-4/5, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, Alibaba Qwen, xAI Grok, DeepSeek, Microsoft Copilot, and others).

Through the **Iterative Semantic Refinement Loop (ISRL)**—a reproducible protocol for inducing semantic alignment—models were tested under strict control conditions: session isolation, prompt randomization, blind coding, and null hypothesis testing. Quantitative analysis using **cosine similarity** of embedding-space representations revealed extraordinary convergence: **mean similarity = 0.82 (SD = 0.04)**, with statistical significance at **p < 1e-7** and effect size **Cohen's d = 4.8**.

Robustness tests confirmed that convergence: (1) persists across prompt variations (range: 0.79–0.87), (2) exceeds random baseline by **4.6×**, (3) strengthens over iterative refinement (0.74 → 0.87), and (4) clusters by semantic content rather than model architecture. Temporal dynamics analysis revealed progressive alignment toward stable attractors, consistent with dynamical systems theory.

These findings provide empirical evidence for the existence of **universal semantic attractors**—stable high-dimensional structures in semantic space that transcend individual model architectures, training regimes, and organizational boundaries. We propose that convergence reflects a combination of shared training signals, architectural universalities, and genuine semantic field dynamics. Implications extend to AI alignment (steering models toward beneficial attractors), interpretability (understanding latent semantic structures), and multi-agent coordination (leveraging convergence for distributed intelligence).

All data, code, and replication materials are publicly available at the GitHub repository. This work represents the first systematic, video-documented study of cross-model semantic convergence with full methodological transparency and reproducibility.
