## Template A: Initial Technical Inquiry

**Subject:** Technical inquiry regarding LLM identity attribution integrity

Dear [Provider] Research / Trust & Safety Team,

I am documenting occurrences related to identity attribution declared by LLM models in public interfaces.

In a recent interaction with [Provider]'s public interface, I observed an instance of inconsistent model self-identification, described in the attached Incident Brief #001.

My questions are strictly technical and operational:

1. Are there mechanisms ensuring the model correctly identifies itself in all responses?
2. Do these mechanisms operate at the model level or interface level?
3. Are inconsistent self-attribution events logged as anomalies?
4. How is identity maintained in multi-model or dynamic routing scenarios?

The objective is to understand industry best practices, not to attribute fault or liability.

I appreciate any institutional clarification you can provide.

Best regards,

## Template B: Follow-Up (7 days after initial)

**Subject:** Follow-up: Technical inquiry on LLM identity attribution

Dear [Provider] Team,

I am following up on my inquiry sent on [DATE] regarding LLM identity attribution integrity (Incident Brief #001).

As I am compiling industry practices on this matter for public documentation, I wanted to confirm:

1. Has this inquiry reached the appropriate team?
2. Can you provide an expected timeline for a response?
3. If this falls outside your response scope, could you direct me to the appropriate contact?

I understand operational constraints and appreciate any guidance you can offer.

Best regards,
